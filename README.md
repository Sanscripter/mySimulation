# mySimulation
Small agent based simulation from back whne I first started learning JS I found a couple of days ago and had a lot of fun changing (and mostly breaking).

# Concepts
This might change, but it was initially enviosioned as an enviroment simulation. Entities (animals) eat Food (plants or other animals) to survive and reproduce. They can die in a couple of ways like starvation, old age and depression/lonliness.

# Roadmap

- [ ] Improved Grid Class
- [ ] Improved World Class
- [ ] Predators
- [ ] Solve stacking of plants upon sproutiong
- [ ] Overhaul UI (improve layout plus create some menus for tweaking with the settings)
- [ ] Add different species (maybe, might not be worth it)
- [ ] Switching to rendering in canvas with agente interactions like hovering to see its stats and whatnot (again, maybe, I do like the terminal vibe and the ascii characters. At the very least I'll make items different colors so it's less dull to look at.)
